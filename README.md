### Controls
To navigate the game seamlessly, familiarize yourself with the intuitive controls:

- **Drag and Drop:** Place your Pokémon on the grid by dragging them onto strategic positions.
- **Pokeball Currency:** Ensure you have sufficient pokeballs to deploy your chosen Pokémon. You can only place a Pokémon if you have the required number of pokeballs for that specific creature.
- **Cooldown Period:** Be mindful of the cooldown period after placing a Pokémon. You'll need to wait before deploying another one.

### Survival Tactics
- **Tower Defense:** Your Pokémon act as formidable defenders against incoming waves of monsters.
- **Defense Health:** Monitor your defense's health bar closely. Once it reaches zero, the game is over.
- **Enemy Threats:** Be prepared for diverse enemy monsters that can defeat your Pokémon and directly attack your defense.

### How to Win
Survive for as long as you can by strategically placing Pokémon, managing your resources, and fending off relentless waves of enemies. Your goal is to protect your defense and prevent its health from dropping to zero.
